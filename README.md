# **A classic Snake game with fancy graphics for [_Numworks_](https://www.numworks.com/).**


## **Personnalisation**

### You can edit the values of the variables from **line 9** to **line 24**.

- You can change the speed or the size on game start of the snake on lines 9 and 10.
- You can change the colours of (almost?) everything in the game from line 11 to line 24.

*To prevent the game from malfunctioning, please do not edit any code after that (line 24).*
